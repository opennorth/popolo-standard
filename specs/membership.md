[No one size fits all](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#reporting_structure) in representing the relationship between people and organizations.

In some cases, a simple binary relation is enough, e.g. a `memberOf` property linking an organization and a person. In other cases, a complex [n-ary relation](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/) is required, e.g. to describe the duration of the person's membership; in such cases, we create a new class to represent the relation, e.g. a `Membership` class, and attach properties to it, like duration, to describe the relationship between the person and the organization.

According to this data specification, a [person](/specs/person.html) is a member of an [organization](/specs/organization.html), and may optionally hold a [post](/specs/post.html) in that organization through their membership, as illustrated by the class diagram below.

The Membership class should have properties for:

1. label

    >Chairman of the XYZ Party

1. the role that the person fulfills in the organization

    >Chairman

1. the [person](/specs/person.html) who is a party to the relationship

    >John Doe

1. the [organization](/specs/organization.html) that is a party to the relationship

    >XYZ Party

1. The [post](/specs/post.html) held by the person in the organization

    >Chairman of the XYZ Party

1. the time interval over which the relationship exists

    >since 2000

1. the means of contacting the person who is a party to the relationship

    >1 Main Street  
    Anytown, USA  
    555-555-0100  
    john@example.com

1. external links

    >A URL to a document about the membership.

<h1 id="standard-reuse">2. Standard reuse</h1>

Briefly, the [survey of existing specifications](/appendices/survey.html) concludes that only the [Organization ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) offers a rich membership model for describing the relation between people and organizations.

## 2.1. Range restrictions

According to the [Organization ontology](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/), either a person or an organization can be a member of an organization; in this data specification, only a person can be a member of an organization.

<p class="note" id="note1">1. The Organization ontology defines the inverse property <code>org:hasMembership</code>.</p>

<h1 id="serialization">4. Serialization</h1>

A membership relation cannot exist without both a person and an organization. All memberships <em class="rfc2119">must</em> therefore assign values to either `person_id` or `person` and to either `organization_id` or `organization`.

**JSON differences from other RDF serializations:**

* The term `label` is used instead of `prefLabel`, to be consistent with the [ContactDetail](/specs/contact-detail.html) class.
* The value of the `role` property is a string, instead of an `org:Role`.
* The term `person_id` is used instead of `member` to conform to <abbr title="object-relational mapper">ORM</abbr> conventions.
* The term `organization_id` is used instead of `organization` to conform to <abbr title="object-relational mapper">ORM</abbr> conventions.
* Given the [complex encoding](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/) of time intervals in RDF, a simple `start_date` and `end_date`[<sup>2</sup>](#note2) pair is used instead of `memberDuring`, as [proposed](http://www.epimorphics.com/web/wiki/organization-ontology-second-draft) by the original developers of the Organization ontology.
* The term `links` is used instead of `seeAlso` and is serialized as an array of [link objects](/specs/#link).

<p class="note" id="note2">2. With respect to reuse, the terms <code>start_date</code> and <code>end_date</code> are used in the <a href="http://vocab.org/participation/schema">Participation ontology</a> and others.</p>
